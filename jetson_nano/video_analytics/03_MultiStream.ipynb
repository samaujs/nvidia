    "Multiple input video streams can be batched together through a single inference pipeline, producing an annotated tiled output.  Any input format supported by GStreamer can be used for the input streams, and any number of streams may be tiled together up to the maximum number that the Jetson can handle - eight streams in the case of the Jetson Nano.  In this notebook, you'll work with the `deepstream-test3` reference application to build applications that use varying numbers of input streams and formats."
